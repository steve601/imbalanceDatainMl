# Handling Imbalanced Data In Data Science

Imbalanced data pertains to datasets where the distribution of observations in the target class is uneven. In other words, one class label has a significantly higher number of observations, while the other has a notably lower count.

When one class greatly outnumbers the others in a classification, there is imbalanced data. Machine learning models may become biased in their predictions as a result, favoring the majority class. Techniques like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class are used in resampling to remedy this.

There are many ways of handling imbalanced data,in these notebooks we focus on oversampling undersampling
